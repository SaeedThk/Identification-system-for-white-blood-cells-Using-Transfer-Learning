# Identification-system-for-white-blood-cells-Using-Transfer-Learning
Identification system for white blood cells (WBCs) in blood. Using transfer learning to create a CNN model to identify WBCs in smear images and discussing Generalization Power

### Introduction
The generalization power is one of the main challenges in the world of artificial intelligence.
In this project, we intend to investigate the generalizability of convolutional networks in the problem of white blood cell classification.
As we all know, white blood cells play an essential role in the immune system. The first signs of any disease appear quickly in white blood cells. In other words, when a person becomes ill, changes in the number of white blood cells in the patient's blood samples become abnormal. Therefore, differential white blood cell counts can be helpful in early diagnosis of the disease. White blood cells in normal peripheral blood consist of 5 general categories (5 classes)
They are: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. In this project, we want to separate these 5 categories from each other with the help of convolutional network.
